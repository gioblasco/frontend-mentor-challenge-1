## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've had to remember some concepts regarding React library, mostly related to state elevation and props. Also, had to go look through some media query examples to work on the component responsiveness.

### Continued development

I guess I have a lot to work on the CSS usage, because I feel I'm not very organized enough. Also, I'm willing to improve my skills with JS libraries/frameworks on future projects.
